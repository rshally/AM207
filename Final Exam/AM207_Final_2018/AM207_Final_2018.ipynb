To do this you will need to sample using the softmax probabilities. A nice way to do this is \"Gumbel softmax sampling\". See http://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2014/07/31/gumbel-max-trick/ for details. Color-code the predictive samples with the gaussian they came from. Superimpose the predictive on the original data. This diagram may look something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "A mixture density network (see the enclosed Chapter 5 excerpt from Bishop or https://publications.aston.ac.uk/373/1/NCRG_94_004.pdf) is very closely related to the mixture of experts model. The difference is that we fit the regressions using a neural network where hidden layers are shared amongst the mean, sigma, and mixing probability regressions. (We could have fit 3 separate neural networks in Part A but opted to fit linear regressions for simplicity)\n",

    "(More explanation [here](https://github.com/hardmaru/pytorch_notebooks/blob/master/mixture_density_networks.ipynb). You are welcome to take code from here with attribution.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You job here is to construct a multi-layer perceptron model with a linear hidden layer with 20 units followed by a `Tanh` activation. After the activation layer, 3 separate linear layers with `n_hidden` inputs and `n_gaussian=3` outputs will complete the network. The probabilities part of the network is then passed through a softmax. The means part is left as is. The sigma part is exponentiated and 0.01 added, as in part A\n",

    "input:1 --linear-> n_hidden -> Tanh --linear-->n_gaussians      ...mu\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to use a loss function for the last layer of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the mean-squared-error loss is not appropriate as the expected value of samples drawn from the sampling distribution of the network will not reflect the 3-gaussian structure (this is the essence of the difference between B4 and B5 above). Thus we'll use the negative loss likelihood of the gaussian mixture model explicitly."
